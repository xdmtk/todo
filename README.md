### Introduction
`todo` is a powerful and intuitive CLI todo-list utility. In contrast to other CLI todo-list programs, the `todo` interface is incredibly simple, with only a couple key commands to know in order to get started. One of the most notable and important features of `todo` is the ability to create and categorize tasks into _Priorities_. 

Priorities are indexed from 0, with importance being sorted in descending order.  For each Priority list, individual to-do items can be added to each Priority, and removed when completed.
